# Morpheus: Spatial Omics Deep Learning Framework

## Introduction
Morpheus is an integrated deep learning framework that takes large scale spatial omics profiles of patient tumors, and combines a formulation of T-cell infiltration prediction as a self-supervised machine learning problem with a counterfactual optimization strategy to generate minimal tumor perturbations predicted to boost T-cell infiltration.

## Features
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Utilizes unlabeled spatial omics data to learn predictive models for T-cell infiltration.
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Generates minimal perturbations to the tumor environment, hypothesizing potential improvements in T-cell responses.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Employs advanced neural network architectures tailored for high-dimensional omics data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets typical of spatial omics studies, enabling robust analysis across numerous patient samples.
